Implementing a multi-Agent RL based controller using DDPG, TD3 and a Vision-based controller for a self-driving vehicle in simulation to play ice-hockey against other agents

I designed and implementated an AI
agent to play ice hockey in pyTuxKart, which is a heavily
modified version of the SuperTuxKart game designed for
teaching purposes. This paper details the motivation,
methods, evaluation metrics, and results obtained by my
trained agent against benchmark agents known as TA
Agents that were bundled along with the game environment.
The final agent was an image-based agent that generated
player actions to score goals against opponent teams based
on the input image as seen by the agent and the agent state.
The final image-based agent described in this article was
able to achieve a score of 76% against the benchmark agent.
